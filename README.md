## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file). It contains information about passengers, including features like Pclass, Age, Sex, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you have a requirements file)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the `TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION.ipynb` notebook.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables. You can find detailed code and explanations in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Training Models

In this project, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are trained to predict survival. Both models are evaluated for their performance.

## Class Imbalance Handling

The class distribution in the dataset might be imbalanced. The project explores techniques such as Random Oversampling to address this issue.

## Model Evaluation

Both models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Results are discussed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The project provides insights into factors affecting survival and highlights the importance of tackling class imbalance for accurate predictions. Detailed results can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
