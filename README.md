## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file). It contains information about passengers, including features like Pclass, Age, Sex, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you have a requirements file)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the `TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION.ipynb` notebook.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables. You can find detailed code and explanations in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Training Models

In this project, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are trained to predict survival. Both models are evaluated for their performance.

## Class Imbalance Handling

The class distribution in the dataset might be imbalanced. The project explores techniques such as Random Oversampling to address this issue.

## Model Evaluation

Both models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Results are discussed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The project provides insights into factors affecting survival and highlights the importance of tackling class imbalance for accurate predictions. Detailed results can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>

This project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning model for Iris flower classification. The model predicts the species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is available [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset). It contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the corresponding species label for 150 Iris flowers.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd iris-flower-classification`
3. Install the required dependencies if necessary.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and execute the classification.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

You can use this project as a reference for building classification models or as a starting point for your own projects. The Jupyter Notebook provides detailed explanations of the code and the machine learning process.

## Modeling <a name="modeling"></a>

This project uses a logistic regression classifier for Iris flower classification. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set for model evaluation. The model's accuracy and other metrics are reported in the results section.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

- Test set accuracy: 97.37%
- F1 Score (Macro): 0.97
- Precision (Macro): 0.97

These results indicate that the classification model performs well in predicting the species of Iris flowers based on their features.
